## HTML logo

To create the brand logo in HTML you can just type: "•fortrabbit" — bullet character, a normal space and then name of the company. Use the Georgia Typeface in bold and italic. 

## Logo usage

- Use lot's of whitespace around the logo
- Don't put other text nearby the logo

## Brand name

- When using the company name within a paragraph of text, write "fortrabbit" with a f, even at the beginning of a sentence.
- Don't use the bullet or any other typeface here.
- Unless in context of billing or official usage, don't add the entity GmbH
